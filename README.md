# Accuracy–Latency Trade-off in Transformer-Based Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a fully reproducible implementation of a comparative study evaluating BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT for binary tweet sentiment classification.

The project analyzes the trade-off between predictive performance (Accuracy, F1-score) and inference efficiency (latency) under a unified pipeline.

## Repository Contents
- Jupyter notebook containing the full experimental pipeline
- requirements.txt for dependency installation
- Reproducible evaluation and latency measurement code

## Models Evaluated
- DistilBERT-base-uncased
- BERT-base-uncased
- RoBERTa-base
